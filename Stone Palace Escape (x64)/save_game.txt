Chamber of Mirrors*You are in an enourmous room surrounded with mirrors reflecting the light from  your torch.  There is a heavy, metal grate in the middle of the floor and a     balcony above you to the right.   You can see doors to North, South, and West.  Additionally, there seems to  be doors to the Northwest and Northeast that are  blocked by iron grates.*0*

West Overlook*You find what looks like a stone switch on the wall.  There is a door to the    East, but it seems to be locked shut.  There is another door to the West.*0*

Falling Passage*The walls of the passage are vacant of any adornments, and the floor is made up of smooth sections of stone.  You see nothing of interest besides the doors to  the South and West.*0*

Garden*Above the tall, stone walls, you see a cloudy, blue sky as there is no ceiling. Sunlight streams in on green foliage and stone benches.  Stone steps descend to somewhere below, but halfway down they are submerged in rushing water.  You see what looks like an old, rusty key on a stretch of grass as well as a door to    the South.  The door to the Southeast won't budge.*1*

Graveyard*You see many graves and tombstones among the dirt.  You see writing on some,    but nothing is legible.  The air is quite musky and you see a switch on the     moss-covered wall.  There is a door to the West.*0*

Place of Confusion*You see a statue in the center of the room, staring with cold, lifeless eyes.   It looks like there's a note at the base of the statue, covered in dust.  There is a door to the South.*1*

Place of Menace*You feel... unsettled.... as if there is a dark presence in the room.  You see  small alcoves in every direction, except for to the North where there is just a blank wall.  The rope you climbed down is dangling above you.*0*
